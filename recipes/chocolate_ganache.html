        <li>1 c. bittersweet chocolate chips</li>    
        <li>1 tbsp. salted butter</li>    
        <li>1 c. heavy cream</li>    
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp. light corn syrup</li>   

        <p><strong>For the chocolate ganache:</strong></p>

        <li>1/2 c. peanut butter chips</li>    
        <li>1 tbsp. salted butter</li>    
    </ul></p>
  
    <p><ol>
        <p><li>Preheat the oven to 350°. Spray a 9-inch round cake 
            pan with nonstick baking spray. Line the bottom of the 
            pan with parchment paper and spray with nonstick baking 
            spray. Set the pan aside. </p></li>
        <p><li>Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, 
            baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; whisk to 
            combine. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the 
            buttermilk, oil, egg and vanilla. Gradually add the flour 
            mixture to the buttermilk mixture, and whisk until well 
            combined. Add the coffee and whisk just until evenly 
            incorporated. </p></li>
        <p><li>Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and bake for 
            28 to 32 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Let 
            the cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Invert onto a 
            cooling rack to cool completely, 1 hour. </p></li>
        <p><li>For the chocolate ganache: In a 4-cup heat-proof 
            liquid measuring cup with a spout, combine the chocolate 
            chips and 1 tablespoon butter. In a small saucepan, 
            bring the cream and light corn syrup to low simmer over 
            medium-low heat. Pour the cream mixture over the chocolate 
            mixture and let it stand for 2 minutes. Stir until very smooth. 
            Set aside until cooled slightly, but still pourable (about 105°), 
            2 to 5 minutes. </p></li>
        <p><li>While chocolate ganache is cooling, set the cake, still on 
            the wire rack, in a rimmed baking sheet.  </p></li>
        <p><li>Once the ganache has cooled slightly, pour it over the cake, 
            making sure to completely cover the top and sides, letting any 
            excess run off into the rimmed baking sheet. Smooth the top of 
            the cake using a large offset spatula.  </p></li>
        <p><li>Immediately transfer the cake to the refrigerator to harden 
            the ganache, 30 minutes. Using 2 large spatulas, carefully 
            transfer the cake to a serving platter. Serve slightly chilled 
            or at room temperature.  </p></li>
        <p><li>For the peanut butter ganache swirl (optional): While the 
            chocolate ganache is cooling in Step 4, combine the peanut 
            butter chips and butter in a small microwavable bowl. 
            Microwave on high until mixture is melted and smooth, 
            30 seconds, stopping to stir after 15 seconds. Transfer peanut 
            butter mixture to a small Ziploc bag with a 1/4-inch hole cut 
            in the corner. Immediately after covering the cake with warm 
            ganache in Step 6, pipe 6 equally spaced lines of the peanut 
            butter mixture across the top of the cake. Using a paring knife 
            or skewer, drag the tip through the peanut butter and ganache 
            in 7 evenly spaced lines perpendicular to the piped peanut 
            butter, alternating the direction of each line. Proceed with 
            Step 7 and cool cake as directed.  </p></li>
