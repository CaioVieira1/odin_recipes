    <p><ul>
        <li>1 lb. sirloin steak, cut into cubes</li>    
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste</li>    
        <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>    
        <li>1/2 whole large onion, finely diced</li>    
        <li>2 whole carrots, finely diced</li>    
        <li>8 oz. cremini or white button mushrooms, stemmed and halved</li>    
        <li>1/2 c. brandy</li>    
        <li>2 c. beef stock</li>    
        <li>2 tbsp. cornstarch</li>    
        <li>1/4 c. sour cream, room temperature</li>    
        <li>1 tsp. (heaping) dijon mustard</li>    
        <li>Cooked egg noodles, for serving</li>    
        <li>Minced parsley, for serving</li>    

    </ul></p>
  
    <p><ol>
        <p><li>Season the steak with salt and pepper, then 
            heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a heavy 
            skillet over medium high heat. Add half the 
            meat to the pan and brown it quickly, about 2 minutes. 
            Remove the first batch to a bowl and cook the 
            rest of the meat. Remove and set all the meat aside. </p></li>
        <p><li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the 
            pan and add the onion, carrots, and mushrooms. 
            Cook until the mixture is deep golden brown, 
            about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the 
            brandy and 2 cups of the stock. Stir, scrape the 
            bottom of the pan, and turn the heat to 
            medium-high. Cook to reduce the liquid by about 
            a third, 3 to 4 minutes.  </p></li>
        <p><li>In a small pitcher, make a slurry by mixing 
            the remaining 1/4 cup stock and the cornstarch 
            with a fork. Pour the slurry into the skillet 
            and cook until the sauce thickens, about 1 to 2 
            minutes. Turn off the heat. Stir in the sour cream 
            and Dijon. Add the beef and stir over low heat until 
            the mixture is nice and piping hot. Taste and adjust 
            seasonings as you like.  </p></li>
        <p><li>Serve over cooked noodles and sprinkle with 
            parsley. </p></li>
